    "## Review of Data and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In review the data was found directly from a quality source. No major preprocessing was necessary, but a few edits were made. After chosing routes based on ensuring users would not find a closed venue and picking from a few themes we tried multiple means of finding the optimal route. A constraint we wanted to make was that distances were going to be based off driving routes, not distances as the bird flies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first started with looking at nearest neighbors optimization. This would reduce the number of calcuations for possibilies to a complexity of O(n^2). High, but not unmanagabe. While this seemed to produce good results there was no difference in routes because we could not find good logic to keep a final destination a hotel and also consider that distance in as a factor of the optimization. We tried reversing things to see if not considering the starting location was better. This actually had worse results most of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We considered a greedy algorithm, which has another nice complexity O(N 2 log2(N)),but due to street distances not allowing for this to be optimal we decided to not attempt it.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there I attempted a brute force approach. This however has a very large complexity, O(n!). When attempting I ran out of our API's free capacities. Because of this we decited to use MapQuest's API that generates the optimal route. for our users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made a randomly selected route for each possible trip selection to see if our optimizations were worth the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "I compared distances of the Nearest Neighbors and the Random route compared to the route MapQuest's API generated. In the end we can see that when the distances between bars were short (the irish and midtown routes), the nearest neighbor's algorithm often performed worse than random. But overall the nearest neighbor performed better than random 75% of the time. So noteably better than random change. Additionally, the Nearest Neighbors outperformed the Mapquest distances 2 times (about 12.5% of the time). The difference was small .3 and .5 miles, but it does show that the API uses algorithms that aren't guarenteed to produce the best outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to do this again, I would consider doing a variation of brute force. First I would calculate all the permuations of the bar stops being 6 and 7 stops that would lead to 720 and 5040 and then add the first stop and last stop to each of those points. And brute force from there. (this would save us from 40320 and 362880 if I didn't take those out). I would also consider calculating the shortest distance from the start to the first the penultimate stop to the hotel stop reducing the compuations (to 126, 727). The logic behind this is each hotel is in a different spot while the starting point is the same always, reducing this point's distance to be optimal does have the potential to help us consistently--though not always. While reducing this complexity drastically increases the risk of not finding the global minimum, the computational save is MASSIVE. There would even be capacity to randomly generate a large number routes without the constrain to help ensure the quality of our result. "
